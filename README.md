Hi, I'm a school teacher with a passion for data and a drive to make an impact in the world. I have been teaching for several years and have developed a strong foundation in educational theory and practice, but I have also been cultivating a love for data analysis and machine learning.

I have been working on side projects to expand my skills in this field, such as participating in online courses, building my own personal projects, and attending data science conferences. My goal is to make a career change to become a data scientist, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to solve complex problems and drive meaningful change.

I believe that my background in education, combined with my enthusiasm for data science, will make me a unique and valuable asset to any organization. I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills and passion for learning to a new role, where I can work on projects that have a direct impact on people's lives and the world we live in.

I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident that I have the drive, determination, and expertise to make a seamless transition into a new career as a data scientist.
